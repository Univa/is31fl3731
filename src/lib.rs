//!
//! Driver for [Lumissil Microsystem's IS31FL3731 integrated circuit](https://www.lumissil.com/assets/pdf/core/IS31FL3731_DS.pdf). Some of the major features of this library are:
//!
//! 1. Use of embedded HAL traits (works with any embedded device that supports the required traits). This means that this driver is platform agnostic.
//! 2. Library features (only turn on what devices you need to save compiled binary space).
//! 3. [Examples](./examples) on how to use this driver. Right now there is only an example on how to use this crate with a raspberry pi. If you're looking for an embedded example check out my [random_matrix github repo](https://github.com/gleich/random_matrix) which uses this driver on the raspberry pi pico (rp2040 microcontroller).
//!
//! ## Install
//!
//! To install this driver in your project add the following line to your `Cargo.toml`'s `dependencies` table:
//!
//! ```toml
//! is31fl3731 = "1.0.2"
//! ```
//!
//! By default this version will only contain the core driver. To use a preconfigured device, such as the [Adafruit CharliePlex LED Matrix Bonnet](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3467), you would need to change this line to include that device:
//!
//! ```toml
//! is31fl3732 = { version = "1.0.2", features = ["charlie_bonnet"] }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Functionality & Plans
//!
//! Currently this library only supports some basic functions of the matrix (e.g. setup, fill, pixels). A few other features need to be implemented:
//!
//! - [ ] autoplay
//! - [ ] fade
//! - [ ] audio_play
//! - [ ] blink
//!
//! ## Inspiration
//!
//! This driver is a port of [adafruit's driver for the is31fl3731](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_IS31FL3731) in the rust programming language.
